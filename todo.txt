From today:
* figure out how to do an easy file catalog from the AER tables
    * can i hash/version those files?
* maybe then figure out a pipeline for querying those variables over time and space?
    * given a 'country' and a timerange, dump summary and rasters?


* how does it know what i need?
* how does h3 indexing a set of geotiffs work, is that efficient then for searching for lat/long groups later over stacks that would have been raster stacks?
* what is carto, hobson wants to use it for visualization.
* get 2024 ERA5 added, getting the monthly updates going in an automated way.
* "source to staging" we already have staging workspace and stagint tables -- rename it to the miro stages
* do all this in notebooks --
