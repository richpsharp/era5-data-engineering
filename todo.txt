Today:
* Get DB pipeline working manually
    * I am not able to get the injection into the table right, seems like a permission things
    * I think there's an issue with determining which catalog to reference,
        I think that should be a "job parameter" when running the job and
        if it doesn't exist default to sandbox. I otherwise have an error about
        whitlisting some permissions, i think for a table, but i don't know
        what table it is making.
* Get DB pipeline working via git actions? Or pull request first?

For later:
* Work on the pest trait pipeline
    * Chnage to stages so we have
        x pull searches
        x pull websites
        x process websites -- in progress
        x NLP part
            x scrubbing the websites so it just has relevant info in progress
            x need to run the LLM questions on the scrubbed websites
        * Fix issue of vote counting gone wrong
